# Algorithm Problems / 水题集锦

Here are some of my solutions to algorithm problems on various Online Judge websites. Hope they can help if you are also preparing for algorithm competitions like Olympiad in Informatics or ACM-ICPC. Most of these solutions were in C/C++, though a few of them were written in [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)).
